# ARM Assembly Language Practice Repository (LPC1768)
Welcome to my ARM Assembly Language practice repository! Here, you'll find a collection of questions that I've solved to enhance my skills in ARM assembly programming. This repository serves as a record of my progress and a resource for others interested in learning or practicing ARM assembly.

## Introduction
ARM assembly language is a crucial skill for embedded systems development, low-level programming, and understanding the architecture of ARM-based processors, such as the LPC1768. This repository contains a set of questions that I've tackled to improve my proficiency in ARM assembly programming on the LPC1768 architecture.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PythonOP/ARM_CodeWork.git
    ```

2. Install [Keil uVision 4](https://www.keil.com/download/product/) on your machine. Keil uVision is an integrated development environment (IDE) for ARM assembly programming and is commonly used for LPC1768 architecture.

3. Set up Keil uVision by configuring the necessary toolchain and project settings. Ensure that you select the appropriate ARM architecture. In my case, I used LPC1768.

4. Make sure you have an ARM assembly compiler and emulator installed on your machine. You can use tools like QEMU or ARM GCC for this purpose, but Keil uVision already comes with an integrated environment for building and emulating ARM programs.

5. Once you have Keil uVision and the necessary tools installed, navigate to the repository's directory and start exploring the questions.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues during the setup process. Happy coding!
